Security Recommendations 

What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?
No sensitive data, such as passwords or pins, is exposed through the user interface.
I chose it because passwords are meant to be provided and exposed only once when the user has to log in. This can be a security issue and can lead to many mistakes.

Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)
It benefits both parties as the user would be secured and the developer would have know well that there isn't any vulnerabilities. 
If the recommendation was found somewhere other than the provided checklist, include a link to it.

When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)?
It should be implemented when the sign in/register page has to be developed and also having to deal with the back end for safe storage. 
Why do you think your project needs your recommendation?
Same when the sign in/register page has to be implemented and having to deal with the backend to ensure safe information transactions. 
How do you think your recommendation could be applied?
It should be applied when he user meets the right password to access all their data.
i) How feasible would the implementation be?
It is possible to do so.
